LabVIEW is a complete software development environment. However LabVIEW is not just a software development environment, since it is used as an alternative to Basic or C language. As a language for developping applications, LabVIEW has all the characteristics of programming languages with different programming style, so it is called the G (Graph) language. When programming with the G language, users usually do not have to write code and actually use flow chart or block diagram [3]. The interface of this platform is programmed with LabVIEW and has these functions: username and password login screen, temperature and humidity monitoring of air and soil, light intensity, carbon dioxide concentration display, historical data collection, waveform display; alarm for upper and lower data, manual control part and visualization functions. The main interface of LabVIEW is shown in Figure 4. Login system is based on LabVIEW software platform, and its main role is to ensure the realization of the security of user and test data. The screen before the login screen is shown in Figure 5.
